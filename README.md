backgammon
==========

Strategy for the classic Backgammon game , implemented using concepts of Artificial Intelligence 

*Game Holding Strategy
Plan on keeping a point in your control that is located highly in your opponent’s board,
     usually a point in his inner board or the bar point.
     ● The 20 point or bar points are the best holding game anchors, as they provide maximum
     chances to hit your opponent as he brings his checkers closer to home. Points further
     back get much weaker.
     ● Another key strategic element to the holding game is the distribution of the opponent’s
     checkers. If he has only the 8 and 13 points made (as in the starting position), he will
     often have to leave a shot as he brings his checkers around. If he has made additional
     landing points in his outer board, your hitting chances go down significantly.
